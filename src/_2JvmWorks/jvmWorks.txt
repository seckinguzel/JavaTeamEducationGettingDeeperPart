1-Java code is compiled into bytecode.
2-Bytecode is loaded into memory and verified for correctness.
3-Bytecode is executed by the JVM.
4-Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation may occur to improve performance.
5-JVM performs optimizations to improve performance.
6-When the program finishes running, the JVM performs cleanup and shuts down.
