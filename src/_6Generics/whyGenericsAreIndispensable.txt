//Declaration of generic method.
public <E> void methodName(E parameter) {
    // method body
}
//<E> is a special declaration fot to declare generic types.

1-Type security is provided by generics during the compilation time.

2-Generics could allow to block cast operations like autoboxing and unboxing. Autoboxing is to convert from primitive type like int to
the object like Integer et cetera unboxing is opposite of the autoboxing process.
-Autoboxing-
int sayi = 5;
Integer sayiObjesi = sayi; // Autoboxing işlemi gerçekleşir
-Unboxing-
Integer sayiObjesi = new Integer(5);
int sayi = sayiObjesi; // Unboxing işlemi gerçekleşir

3-Generics are more flexible structure. You don't need to write different methods for each different objects. You can write in one
framework.
