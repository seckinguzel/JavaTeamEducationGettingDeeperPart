What is the difference between an array and list?
In Java, an array is a fixed-size data structure that stores elements of the same data type in contiguous (biti≈üik) memory locations,
accessed by their index. Once created, the size of an array cannot be changed.

On the other hand, a list is an interface in Java that defines an ordered collection of elements,
which can be of different data types. Unlike arrays, lists are dynamic in size and can grow or shrink as needed during runtime.

Arrays are fixed-size and store elements of the same data type,
while lists are dynamic and can store elements of different data types.

What is the difference between Map and Set?
The main difference between Map and Set in Java is that Map is used to store key-value pairs where each key is unique,
while Set is used to store a collection of unique elements.
